1. Mailing Labels From the Northwind database we used in class and SQLite, create mailing labels for customer representatives. Each label should consist of six, and exactly six, lines. The mailing labels should be suitable for printing on sticky label paper, speci?cally Avery 8160 labels. The format should be as follows:
TITLE FIRSTNAME LASTNAME COMPANYNAME STREET ADDRESS CITY STATE ZIP COUNTRY [blank line] [blank line]

select contacttitle || " " || contactname || "
   ...> " || companyname || "

   ...>
   ...>
   ...> " from customers;


2. Telephone Book From the Northwind database we used in class and SQLite, create a telephone book for customer representatives. Each line in the telehone book should consist of the representative last name, representative ?rst name, company name, and telephone number. Each row should look like this.
Lastname, Firstname Middlename [tab] Company name [tab] phone number

select substr(contactname, instr(contactname, " "), instr(contactname, " ")+1) || " , " || substr(contactname, 1, instr(contactname, " ")-1) || " " || companyname || " " || phone from customers;
   
   
3. Shipping Lag From the Northwind database, create a report from Orders showing the shipping lag between order date and shipped date. The report should contain four columns: the order umber, the order date, the shipped date, and the di?erence in days between the order date and the shipped date.

sqlite> select orderid, orderdate, shippeddate, julianday (shippeddate) - julianday (orderdate) from orders;


4. Your Age: How old are you, in days, today? Use Sqlite to calculate this.
